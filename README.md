# NBA Stats Season 20-21 Web Scraping
I did web scraping of NBA players stats in the 20-21 season, ordered by their average scored points per match. For this scrap, I have used two libraries: Selenium and BeautifulSoup. With Selenium, I prepared the web page with all data that I wanted to collect, because in that page there are only 50 players visibles and you need to press the button "Show More" to see the rest. After this, with BeautifulSoup I did the web scraping and finally I saved the table that I have obtained in one CSV file.
The code and the CSV file are inside the NBA Stats 20-21 folder.

As a last nuance I would like to say that, as you could see if you look the .ipynb folder, my code is written in Spanish.

I'm a begginer with BeautifulSoup and Selenium libraries and I'm not a professional with Python because I started to learn this programming language last summer, so If someone see something that could be better readable and more efficient, I will be very thankful to know it!!
