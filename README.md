# NBA Stats Season 20-21 Web Scraping
I did web scraping of attacking players stats of NBA in the 20-21 season. For this scrao, I have used two libraries: Selenium and BeautifulSoup. With Selenium, I prepared the page with all data that I wanted to collect, because in the page there are only 50 players visibles and you need to press the button "Show More" to see the rest. After this, with BeautifulSoup I did the web scraping and finally I saved the table that I have obtained in one CSV file.
The code and the result (the CSV file) is inside the NBA Stats 20-21 folder.

As a last nuance, I would like to say that, as you could see if you look the .ipynb folder, my code is written in Spanish.
